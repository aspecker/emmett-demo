## Adam Specker 10/2/18

### Getting Started

- Why am I writing this?
  - I just discovered Emmet and was blown away by how neat, useful and easy it is
  - I want to share it with as many people as possible
  - Check out [Emmet](https://emmet.io/)
  - Many thanks to Ray Villalobos whose [Lynda Emmet course](https://www.lynda.com/Emmet-tutorials/Coding-Faster-Emmet/133353-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3aemmet%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) inspired me

* What is Emmet?
  * Emmet is a powerful tool to enable you to write HTML and CSS rapidly, efficiently, and without irritating typos
  * In a sense, it represents shorthand for CSS/HTML
  * Highly customizable with lots of useful hotkeys, Emmet can save you time AND help you write more accurate code

* How do I get Emmet?
  * Emmet is available for a wide variety of IDEs
  * It is available in VSCode out of the box
  * Navigate [here](https://emmet.io/download/) to check availability for your favorite editor
  * **NOTE** that some of Emmet's keybindings may conflict with your editor/OS
    * Feel free to customize your IDE, OS, or Emmet's keybindings to your liking

### Core Commands

* Emmet comes with many useful commands to quickly generate html elements
* View [Emmet Syntax Docs](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/) as a reference
* **NOTE** in Vscode, the command to bring up the emmet selector is `Ctrl + Space`
  * keep this in mind when editing your chained Emmet commands (more on this later)

* Creating Elements
  * Emmet can autocreate elments with minimal syntax
  * h1 => `<h1></h1>`
